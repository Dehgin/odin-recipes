# odin-recipes
First project on The Odin Project!
Finally starting my first HTML project, where I will create barebones webpages to navigate through recipes.
Don't forget to use github and clone the SSH into terminal to have a local git log
Good luck!

In order to complete this assignment, you will have to setup a homepage, create absolute and relative links, add absolute and relative images, and do so flawlessly.
Don't forget to commit regularly and include brief summaries
